						Vegan Snack Packs is the love child of Vegan Chef Naomi Mariano aka “Chef Nay”.
						Chef Nay grew up in a household where both parents enjoyed cooking. Her father, a native of the Philippines and a cook in the U.S. Navy, taught her traditional Filipino cooking. Her mother of French and Native American descent taught her traditional American dishes. With roots like that her destiny was sealed!
					</p>
					<p>
						Naomi has always been happiest when she’s experimenting in the kitchen. While she has cooked and prepared meals for friends and family her whole life she didn’t start her professional career until many years later when she first learned about veganism.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2010 Naomi’s boyfriend and now fiancé, Dave decided to go fully vegan after experimenting with it off and on for nearly a decade. This meant that making food for him was about to be a huge new culinary experiment (actually her real words were “this is going to be a pain in my butt”). Never one to shy away from a challenge Nay was up for the adventure.
					</p>

					<p>
						It didn’t her take long to realize that vegan cooking offered tons of opportunity. Most people picture vegans eating salads and tofu all day but the plant kingdom is diverse and the food options are nearly infinite. For example did you know that there are nearly 500 different types of avocados? Yeah 500!! And there are tons of exotic fruits and vegetables that most people have never heard of let alone tried. Ever heard of these exotic fruits; durian, pomelo, rambutan, or mangosteen? Honestly we’re not even sure how to pronounce some of those names but we sure do like how they taste! But we digress, back to Chef Nay!
					</p>
					<p>
						After learning and adapting a few of her cooking skills for vegan food Naomi realized that she was becoming quite passionate about the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. A self-proclaimed lioness Naomi realized that she was feeling better and healthier the more she moved to eating like an herbivore with a fully plant based diet. As the transition continued and she learned more about the atrocities associated with factory farming she made the rest of the switch with ease. And thus Chef Nay was born! Within just a few months of that decision Chef Nay was taking on private clients and making snacks 7 days a week for clients and friends to buy and eat.
					</p>
					<p>
						With a desire to bring healthy and delicious tasting snacks to a broader audience Chef Nay created Vegan Snack Packs as a convenient way for anyone to obtain great snacks for themselves and their families.

					<p>
						While eating vegan is defined as consuming only a plant based diet that doesn’t always mean that a snack labeled “vegan” is healthy. Technically an Oreo cookie is vegan but that doesn’t mean they are good for you. There are some easy rules to follow to make the most out of a whole food plant based diet. Here’s our short list:
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="process-main-abt">
					<div class="process-left-abt">
						<div class="inner-process-left">
							<h1>1.Eat organic. </h1>
							<p>
								Do we really need to explain why? Less chemicals healthier food. All our ingredients are organic.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="inner-process-left">
							<h1> 2.Try not to cook foods over approximately
							118 degrees. </h1>
							<p>
								Heat kills enzymes and minerals. The hotter and longer you cook your food the less nutrition you’ll find in it. We dehydrate all our snacks below 118 degrees to maximize the minerals and enzymes in every bite.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="process-right-abt">
						<div class="inner-process-left">
							<h1>3. Soak seeds and nuts. </h1>
							<p>
								By soaking seeds and nuts in water it removes the enzyme inhibitor making them far easier to digest. No flavor is lost and your body makes better use of the nutrients. Yep we do this too.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="inner-process-left">
							<h1>4. Eat the rainbow.</h1>
							<p>
								The more colors you have on your plate the more nutrients you’re getting. And remember the center of the rainbow is green. You can never go wrong incorporating green whole foods into your meals and snacks. Have you tried our kale?
